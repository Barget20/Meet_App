<h1> Meet_App Project: <h1>
  
<p> This project was made to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development technique (TDD). 
  A Google Calendar API was used to fetch upcoming events. <p>
  
<h2> Description: <h2>  
  
  <p> In this project we used TDD, a Google Calendar API, and is a step away from being verified. The key features of this app is to be able to filter events by city,
    show/hide event details, specifiy the number of events, and be able to view a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city. The app is also allowed to be used when offline. 
    It has also been converted into a PWA and can be added as a shortcut to the home screen.
